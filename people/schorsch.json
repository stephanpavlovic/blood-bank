    "description": "George knows Railslove since our early days when we shared our first office. After his career as a mechanic he started to enhance web-software engines and made things like freakyphones.de. He then got fed up with running his businesses with crappy software and built SalesKing. George is one of our ruby teachers but can also be booked for mechanic & moped lessons.",
